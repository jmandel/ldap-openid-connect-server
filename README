This is a version of the MITREid Connect server that speaks to a backend LDAP system for its user information and authentication.
```
cd ldap-server-overlay
mvn package jetty:run-war
```

In Eclipse, you can set up a Debug configuration to run these same goals ("package
jetty:run-war") on the ldap-server-overlay project.
